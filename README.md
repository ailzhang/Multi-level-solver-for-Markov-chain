# Multi-level-solver-for-Markov-chain
Implement "A multi-level solution algorithm for steady-state Markov chains" by Graham Horton etc.

The current GS.py is Gauss-Seidel implementation in python, based on the algorithm given in CS541 module3 ppt(slide 65).

We also use MCL algorithm from "Van Dongen, S. (2000) Graph Clustering by Flow Simulation. PhD Thesis, University of Utrecht, The Netherlands." as a new aggregation strategy to compare with the basic strategy in the paper.

If you have any questions, please contact Ailing Zhang, Yongli Chen and Le Xu.
